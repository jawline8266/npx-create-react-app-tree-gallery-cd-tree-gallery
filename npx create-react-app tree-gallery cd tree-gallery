        Jamie wants an app to use images for income, but those images could be copyrighted, so we should warn about license issues. Offering ideas like a wallpaper app or an NFT is good. A Flutter/React Native app for ads, or a simple PWA with Stripe for payments, could work. However, original images or licensed stock would be safer to avoid IP problems. We can help with a ready-to-go web app too.
